# Hi! I'm Ezekiel :smile:
Economics and Finance Graduate, based in the UK.

I am about to embark on the beginning of my career as a Business Analyst in September after recently graduating from university. I have a keen eye for detail and a strategic mindset and I am dedicated to driving growth and efficiency within organisations. From analysing data to providing actionable recommendations, I am committed to facilitating informed decision-making and helping businesses thrive in dynamic environments. 

I have an interest in Machine Learning, Computational Finance and Data Analytics. I am always up for a challenge!
